How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Using a consistent coding style, keeping functions and classes small, using meaningful naming conventions,
writing modular code, writing plenty of comments, and testing code rigorously

Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The CRUD module could be used with more databases

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
Understand the problem, design a solution, implement the solution, and check the solution

Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
My approach was similar to other courses although I needed to ask for lots of help

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I could start by defining objectives and scope of the project

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
Computer scientists create innovative solutions to problems and advance the capabilities of computers and technology
Computer scientists matter because we keep businesses running

How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
So far the project does not run successfully and instead gives me a timeout error. I wonder if it's because of the CRUD module
